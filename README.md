# About
Chaotic Card Writer is a light-weight application designed to assist in filling out stat values onto blank card images from the Trading Card Game "Chaotic."

The application is developed in C# using Windows Forms for the GUI. Currently the application is only available on the Window platform, but cross-platform development will be considered in the future if there's demand for it.

## History
The program was originally developed in Python to speed up the process of developing a mod for Tabletop Simulator. Upon reviewing the original application, many potential improvements were considered and implemented into a complete re-write in C#. It also doesn't look like it was coded by a blink chimpanzee anymore.

# Distribution
